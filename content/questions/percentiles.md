A percentile is the level below which a given percentage of simulations fall
when they are put in order according to a variable such as temperature. For
instance, the 50th percentile in the atlas includes the lower 50% of the climate
projections. The 10th percentile of precipitation projections may show
significant drying, while the 90th percentile might show much wetter conditions.
