A percentile is the level below which a given percentage of simulations fall
when they are put in order according to a variable such as temperature. For
instance, the 50th temperature percentile shows the highest temperature in the
lower 50% of the distribution of temperature changes. The 10th percentile of
precipitation projections may show significant drying, while the 90th percentile
might show much wetter conditions.
