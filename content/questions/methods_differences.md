question: What are the differences between the methods?

There are several differences between the constraint methods used in this
analysis, including the kind of observational data they use and how the results
are handled statistically. For instance, the UKCP and ClimWIP methods both use
multiple observed variables (eg. temperature, precipitation) to constrain their
projections, rather than just using the target variable being reported.

Some methods constrain their variables at different spatial scales, from global
to local, before deriving constrained local projections. Different methods also
handle uncertainty in the projections differently.

The following table includes the key characteristics of the different methods
and is reprinted from Brunner et al. (2020), which contains more information on
the differences between these methods.
