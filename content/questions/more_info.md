Please view the references section below for more on the background research
behind this Atlas. For more on the EUCP project, please head to [our
website](https://www.eucp-project.eu/). This Atlas has been produced by Work
Package 2 of EUCP, which is described in more detail
[here](https://www.eucp-project.eu/the-project/work-packages-wps/wp-2/).

The following paper provides an overview including all methods:

* [Comparing Methods to Constrain Future European Climate Projections Using a
  Consistent Framework](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0953.1)
