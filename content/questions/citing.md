Great! You can cite the Atlas using its DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5654741, and
citation information on the [Zenodo
repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5654741).

If you want to cite a particular figure or piece of content shown in this Atlas,
the information for its citation can be found under "Where can I find more
information?".
