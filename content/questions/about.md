This atlas shows several different model projections of the European climate in
2050, illustrating the effect of constraining the projections. Not all climate
simulations are equally likely, however this is not routinely addressed in
current climate projections. Methods of isolating the more likely projections
include comparing a simulation of the past to observed climate data recorded at
the time. This can suggest how well the simulation may project the future. This
process is known as 'constraint' and can affect the results given by an ensemble
of climate simulations by ruling out the poorer simulations.
