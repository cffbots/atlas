question: What do these maps show?

This Atlas shows several different model projections of the European climate in
2050, illustrating the effect of constraining the projections. Each map shows
differences between 2041-2060 mean conditions with respect to the 1995-2014
baseline. Not all climate simulations are equally likely, however
this is not routinely addressed in current climate projections. Methods of
isolating the more likely projections include comparing a simulation of the past
to observed climate data recorded at the time. This can suggest how well the
simulation may project the future. This process is known as 'constraint' and can
affect the results given by an ensemble of climate simulations by ruling out the
poorer simulations.
