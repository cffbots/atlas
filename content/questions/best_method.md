question: Which method is best?

The question of which constraint method is best depends on what the projection is being used for. Some methods have particular strengths over others. For example, some methods provide relative weights of available simulations that could be used to select models to drive downstream climate impact analysis, and
some methods can provide physically consistent projections for a number of variables.

Method performance can be different in different areas or with different variables. One method, for instance, could bring significant improvements over unconstrained projections in northern Europe but not in the Mediterranean region.

It should be noted, however, that all the constraint methods used in the Atlas confer some improvement over unconstrained projections for summer temperature, and strongly related variables, and most provide improvements for all regions.
