- question: What do these maps show?
  answer: >
    This atlas shows several different model projections of the European
    climate in 2050, illustrating the effect of constraining the projections. Not
    all climate simulations are equally likely, however this is not routinely
    addressed in current climate projections. Methods of isolating the more likely
    projections include comparing a simulation of the past to observed climate
    data recorded at the time. This can suggest how well the simulation may
    project the future. This process is known as ‘constraint’ and can affect the
    results given by an ensemble of climate simulations by ruling out the poorer
    simulations.

- question: What are the differences between the methods?
  answer: >
    There are several differences between the constraint methods used in this
    analysis, including the kind of observational data they use and how the
    results are handled statistically. For instance, the UKCP and ClimWIP methods
    both use multiple observed variables (eg. temperature, precipitation) to
    constrain their projections, rather than just using the target variable being
    reported. Some methods constrain their variables at different spatial scales,
    from global to local, before deriving constrained local projections. Different
    methods also handle uncertainty in the projections differently. The following
    table includes the key characteristics of the different methods and is
    reprinted from Brunner et al. (2020), which contains more information on the
    differences between these methods.

- question: What do the percentiles mean?
  answer: >
    A percentile is the level below which a given percentage of
    simulations fall when they are put in order according to a variable such as
    temperature. For instance, the 50th percentile in the atlas includes the lower
    50% of the climate projections. The 10th percentile of precipitation
    projections may show significant drying, while the 90th percentile might show
    much wetter conditions.

- question: Which method is best?
  answer: >
    The question of which constraint method is best depends on what the
    projection is being used for. Some methods have particular strengths over
    others.  For example, some methods provide relative weights of available
    simulations that could be used to select models to drive downstream climate
    impact analysis, and some methods can provide physically consistent
    projections for a number of variables. Method performance can be different
    in different areas or with different variables. One method, for instance,
    could bring significant improvements over unconstrained projections in
    northern Europe but not in the Mediterranean region.   It should be noted,
    however, that all the constraint methods used in the Atlas confer some
    improvement over unconstrained projections for summer temperature, and
    strongly related variables, and most provide improvements for all regions.
