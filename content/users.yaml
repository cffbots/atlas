  about: This user works in a government department of a European nation, with a focus on long term local development planning. They have a working familiarity with headline messages coming out of climate science (such as produced in IPCC reports). They do not necessarily know how these headline messages relate to their particular part of Europe nor do they have the understanding of the underlying science that informs climate projections nor the technical capabilities or time to analyse them.
  interest: This user's role is to raise awareness about potential climate change impacts as part of wider longer-term planning. This is to inform the engagement with local authorities within the country. This country is one of many European nations that does not yet have established National Climate Scenarios. They would like to make use of graphical representation that represents the magnitude of climate change within their region. This is not intended as a decision-making tool but as a way to raise awareness of potentially climate change impact as part of wider planning. As such, they are looking for an off the shelf visualisation based on data and analysis that would have credibility in scientific circles.
  process: The EUCP Atlas provides maps of projected European climate change for a time period centred on 2050. This timescale matches the roughly 30 to 50-year planning horizon of the infrastructure planning that this user is hoping to inform. They could opt to just represent the central estimate from the latest generation of climate simulations (by opting for an unconstrained CMIP6 estimate from one of the methods in the percentile maps in the Atlas). However, they decide to use visualisations from one of the estimates that weighted projected future changes against how consistent their historical simulations were with observed climate changes by opting for a constrained CMIP6 estimate from one of the methods in the percentile maps in the Atlas. This user is not interested in the particular strengths and limitations of individual climate change methodologies and is initially uncertain about which visualisation to choose. They are encouraged that central estimates from all the represented methods agree on the broad messages around most likely changes. The focus on awareness raising, rather than informing decisions, makes most of the quantitative differences between methodologies less relevant to this user. In the end they choose one which is well referenced, so they can point to these should the details be challenged at a later stage. For most of the cases, this user opts to make use of just central estimates (50 percentile maps in the Atlas). However, in discussion around planning for future water availability this user also opts to include maps of lower likelihood but high-end changes as the projections suggest quite substantial reductions in summer rainfall may be possible in this particular user’s country (10 percentile rainfall maps in the Atlas).

  about: This user is a climate scientist working on storm surge modelling as part of a wider EU consortium project. She works with output from climate simulations as a core part of her work and has colleagues who have contributed to the development of these models. She is technically literate and able to handle, process and visualise climate model output as part of her day-to-day work.
  interest: She is currently tasked with running a number of coupled regional surge-wave models of the North Sea (to explore changes in storm surges). These are computationally very expensive to run, and she can only afford a run a small handful. So, her initial task is to select a subset of climate models to use as input to the surge-wave models. She wants this selected subset of climate simulations to be able to capture central, low- and high-end estimates of projected future climate change - as each of these speaks to different messages. Whilst the central estimate indicates the more likely projected change, she also wants to inform what the minimum and maximum adaptions pathways might need to look like.
  process: Initially, she makes use of the output from the various constraint methodologies to explore projected low (10 percentile), central (50 percentile) and high end (90 percentile) changes. She can compare these constrained ranges with the changes in the individual climate models that she has already computed. This enables her to identify candidate models that might fit her criteria and span the range she requires. She found that all the CMIP6-based methods tended to down weight the upper temperature change (often use as a metric of the magnitude of climate change) compared to the standard CMIP6 dataset. This helped her identify models with slightly smaller magnitude responses that would better represent a plausible high-end scenario. The impact of observational constraints was more modest for the central and low end estimated changes. However, the observational constraints are also effective at ruling out poor simulations even where doing so does not impact the overall range of projected changes. Two of the methodologies (REA and ClimWIP) both provide weights for each model that they use in their assessment. These weights can be used as a measure of plausibility of each individual climate simulation. In the end, she chooses to use weights from the ClimWIP method for two reasons. The first was because ClimWIP provides a measure of model plausibility across a range of observational variables (including circulation) whereas the off-the-shelf implementation of REA based these weights on only observations of temperature and precipitation for projections of each of these variables, respectively. For the storm surge modelling, the plausibility of the circulation and winds are the most important variables and whilst ClimWIP does not target these two variables in isolation, its wider assessment of plausibility across a number of variables can be hoped to rule out generally poor climate simulations. Secondly and relatedly, ClimWIP retains coherency across variables and geographical locations. In contrast REA’s weights are based only on how well a particular simulation reproduced observations for the target variable, and so REA may not give the same measure of good or poor models if it was to be applied to a different variable. So, she ended up using the output from all CMIP6 based methods to identify potential candidates for boundary conditions for her surge-wave models that represented central, low- and high-end climate change. She extended this analysis by using individual model weights from ClimWIP to ensure that the choice of candidates would not be ruled out as poor comparisons compared to the observed changes. The implementation of the ClimWIP methodology in ESMValTool was seen as an added advantage is it would enable this method to be rerun for new climate model data, should the requirements for new storm surge modelling emerge later in her project.
- function: Hydrological modeller
  name: Jane Doe

  about: This user is a hydrological modeller, working to link climate change impact in a small-scale regional river basin in Europe. Her role has many technical and scientific challenges, and she is comfortable processing analysing geospatial data but is not overly familiar with climate simulations. Her experience with them comes from reading hydrological impact papers, where they are often used as a boundary condition.
  interest: Their interest in climate data Like user 2, she is looking to use climate model output to drive her hydrological modelling. Most of her applications are envisaged to revolve around a central estimate climate scenario of the hydrological impacts. This is intended to be used for detailed impacts analysis by users of her hydrological outputs. The presence of biases in rainfall in the climate model data used as boundary conditions is an issue for her approach. Information on where the projected changes in rainfall in the central estimate scenario, sit within the wider uncertainty ranges would be important context for users of her data. Her users will be able to relate that to their own risk tolerance for their own dynamic adaptation strategies.
  process: Initially she uses the Atlas to assess central estimates for projected climate change looking at precipitation (as the main variable of interest) and temperature changes (as a metric of the magnitude of regional climate change). These estimates qualitatively agreed on the broad changes, whilst differences exist in the magnitude of some regional details. Next, she wanted to make use of model weights to help identify an individual climate model configuration to use as her baseline estimate. Two methods provide weights to individual users, REA and ClimWIP. Due to issues that would be introduced should there be large historical biases between the driving boundary data (climate model used as the input) and observations, she opts to use REA as the model weights explicitly target present day rainfall bias. Using these weights, she identifies one of the more highly weighted climate models that lies close to the (multi-method) central estimates, which she can then pull off the Climate Model Intercomparison Data Archive. Having produced her own hydrological impact simulations (based on a central climate change estimate scenario) and started engagement with users of her data, she returns to the Atlas as a way to provide context on her top-level messaging. The climate simulation that she is using as her central estimate of climate change shows 10% to 20% rainfall reductions in the summer season. First, she looks at the level of agreement in the central estimates and notes how her chosen central estimate compares to central estimates from the range of constraint methods. Secondly, she looks at how well the methods agree on the upper bounds. On the lower bounds the methods suggest a range between neutral and even a small moistening, but she can discount these differences as they lie well within the historical variability. The upper bounds (10 percentile rainfall maps in the Atlas) suggest stronger drying is possible, with reductions up to 50%, but there is less agreement on the magnitude of this reduction across methodologies. This message forms an important context strand in her communication of her own results. Users of her data will relate these messages to their own risk tolerance, which can inform their own dynamic adaption strategies. Flexible adaption strategies are often based around a plan made for a central estimate of change, but the high end is used to (a) scan for options/risks and (b) used for monitoring to assess whether a plan B would be needed. The more risk adverse may well come back at a later stage to request new hydrological scenarios that explore this high-end impact.
- function: Financial analyst
  name: John Doe
  avatar: personae/analyst.jpg
  about: This user works as a financial analyst. Highly numerate and technically competent, he has a broad range of analytical skills, toolsets and expertise but lacks a background in climate science.
  interest: The company is looking to update its own guidance on the management of its extensive building portfolio, including questions of divestment and further investment. These assets are distributed across both eastern and western Europe. They are looking for guidance and/or data so that their own analyst team can stress test their building portfolio. They have their own internal estimate for the vulnerability of their assets to climate. These assets could be particularly exposed to either flooding, high temperatures or windstorms. Costs are disproportionately skewed for higher end impacts, and so any cost-benefit analysis has tended to be sensitive to estimates of where the plausible upper bounds are.
  process: The analysts have previously taken climate model data straight from the current climate model archives. CMIP6 has provided a bit of a shock to their assessment process as it includes a larger number of simulations that are above what would previously have been seen as the upper bound (based on earlier climate model archives), and as such appears to change the risk assessment across their portfolio. The CMIP6 based methodologies are useful in that they suggest that some of the high impact summer temperature responses in CMIP6, whilst still plausible, are less likely. There appears to be some consensus about this from the different methods, though these methods disagree, spatially, on where they down weight the stronger climate change signals. There is less consensus in the CMIP6 based methods on the changes in rainfall, with clear but noisy signals in REA compared to little evidence of information (one way or another) in ClimWIP. Because he is looking for information to inform their internal pan-Europe risk assessment, he opts to use ClimWIP in favour of REA because it retains spatial coherency. The Atlas also provides a new strand of evidence that his previous experience with raw climate model data has not exposed him to. The Atlas includes climate projection data from the UKCP methodology, which produces wider probability distributions for projected European changes. This is because it also accounts for both wider modelling and carbon cycle uncertainties that are not accounted for the main experimental design in the current climate model archive. Including these additional uncertainties implies that some of the higher end impacts may be more likely than projections based solely on CMIP5 or CMIP6 data (including associated probabilistic methodologies) would suggest. This again, provides new context for their existing ‘in-house’ risk assessments.
