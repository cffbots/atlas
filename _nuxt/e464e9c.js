ETH, CNRS, ICTP and UKMO methods are based on weighting available historical-future simulations (based on how well they reproduce observed climate). As such the probabilistic projections will always reflect a subset of existing simulations. Edin and Oxford methods both scale the simulations to best match observations. Unlike the former category, their projected future changes can fall outside the range of the underlying simulations. Where projected changes do fall outside this range, there are potential strengths and reasons to be cautious about the how we interpret these changes. The strength of these methods is that they can potential compensate for real world processes that are missing or unrepresented in the simulations. For example, there are cases of observed historical rainfall changes being larger than any simulated. In these cases, the methods may be better able to compensate for any simulated underestimation of the actual climate response. Caution may also be warranted in that available simulations represent the range of responses arising from our current physical understanding of these process - so methods that adjust projected changes outside these ranges may push these into responses which are less physically realistic.")]),e._v(" "),n("li",[e._v("Differences in sources of uncertainty accounted for.
